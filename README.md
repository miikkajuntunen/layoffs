## Data cleaning and transformation
The first step in our project was all about cleaning up the raw layoff data. We wanted to make sure everything was accurate and consistent. Here are the steps in the cleaning process:

- __Removing Duplicates__: Removed duplicate entries to maintain data integrity and avoid redundancy.
- __Standardizing Data__: Standardized the format and structure of the data to simplify further analysis.
- __Handling Null Values and Blanks__: Addressed missing or incomplete data points by either filling in the gaps or removing them as necessary.
- __Removing Columns and Rows__: Removed irrelevant columns and rows that did not serve our analytical objectives.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
After cleaning and preparing the data, I moved into the analysis phase to extract  insights. Here are some of the key analyses conducted:

__Geographic and Industry Analysis__: Analyzed layoffs by country, location, and industry to identify geographic and sector-specific trends. 

__Company and Stage Analysis__: Aggregated layoffs at the company level to identify which organizations had the highest and the lowest numbers of layoffs. Additionally, I investigated the influence of company stages on layoffs.

__Temporal Analysis__: Examined layoffs data by year to track any overarching trends over time. Further broke down the data by month, to get a more detailed analysis of the layoffs.
